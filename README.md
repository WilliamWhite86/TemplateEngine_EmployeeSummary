# Employee Template Generator

##  A software team generator - a command line application.

**This application uses node.js with the inquirer, fs, and util modules. It then uses constructors and extends the employee object. This assignment in particular uses template literals to generate an html page displaying any number of employees**

## Objects extending the employee object

- Manager
- Engineer
- Intern
